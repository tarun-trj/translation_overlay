# üåê Real-Time Screen Translator

![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.10+-blue.svg)
![Platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/platform-Windows-lightgrey.svg)

A high-performance, on-screen translator for Windows that captures a selected application window, recognizes text using OCR, and overlays the translation in real-time.

This tool is designed for performance, using a **multi-process architecture** to ensure your GUI never freezes, even during intensive OCR and translation tasks. It's perfect for translating games, applications, or any on-screen text that you can't copy.

## ‚ú® Features

-   üïí **Real-Time Translation**: Automatically detects visual changes in the target window and updates translations.
-   ‚ö° **High Performance**: Utilizes multithreading for screen capture and multiprocessing for OCR/translation to ensure a smooth, non-blocking experience.
-   üß† **Parallel Processing**: Translates multiple text blocks simultaneously using a process pool for significantly faster results.
-   üéØ **Windowed Capture**: Select any open application window to translate.
-   üåç **Multi-Language Support**: Choose from multiple source languages (Japanese, Korean, Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional) via an intuitive dropdown menu.
-   ü§ñ **Smart Language Detection**: Automatically detects the language of each text block and only translates content matching your selected source language.
-   ‚è∏Ô∏è **Interactive Controls**: A simple floating overlay provides one-click controls to pause/resume (‚è∏/‚ñ∂) translation or force a manual refresh (‚Üª).
-   üß∞ **Dynamic & Configurable**: Automatically finds your Tesseract installation and includes clear settings for language, performance, and sensitivity.
-   ü™ü **Intelligent Overlay**: A transparent, click-through overlay that automatically resizes text to fit within the original text block boundaries. The overlay itself is excluded from screen captures, so it won't be re-translated.
-   üîç **Debug Mode**: Optional visualization of recognized text boundaries with red outlines for troubleshooting.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The application's architecture separates the user interface from heavy processing tasks, ensuring the GUI remains responsive at all times.

1.  **Control Panel (Main UI Thread)**: Built with PyQt6, the main window handles language selection, target window selection, and starting/stopping the translation process.
2.  **Capture & Detection Thread (`TranslationWorker`)**: Runs in the background, continuously capturing screenshots of the selected window, comparing frames to detect visual changes, and avoiding redundant processing when the screen is static.
3.  **OCR & Translation Subprocess**: To prevent GUI lag, OCR and translation are executed in a separate process.
    -   **OCR Stage**: Tesseract OCR analyzes the captured image to extract text blocks.
    -   **Language Detection Stage**: Each text block is analyzed using `langdetect` to identify its language, ensuring only matching content is translated.
    -   **Parallel Translation Stage**: A `multiprocessing.Pool` translates all validated text blocks simultaneously.
4.  **Overlay Window (`OverlayWindow`)**: The translated text is rendered via a transparent, frameless, click-through PyQt6 window, positioned accurately over the original text locations.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

1.  **Python 3.10+** installed and added to your system's PATH.
2.  **Tesseract OCR Engine** installed from the [official repository](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).

> **CRITICAL:**
>
> -   During the Tesseract installation, make sure to select the required language packs for the languages you want to translate from (e.g., Japanese, Korean, Chinese).
> -   Ensure the option **"Add Tesseract to the system PATH"** is checked during installation. The script relies on this to find the Tesseract executable.

### üì¶ Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tarun-trj/translation_overlay.git
    cd translation_overlay
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    The `requirements.txt` file contains all necessary packages.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2.  **Select Source Language:** Choose the language you want to translate FROM using the dropdown menu in the control panel.

3.  **Select a Window:** Click the "Select a Window to Translate" button and choose your target application from the dropdown list.

4.  **Start Translation:** Click "Start Translation."

The translation overlay will appear on top of the target window, and a small control panel with pause (‚è∏) and refresh (‚Üª) buttons will appear in the top-right corner of your screen.

> **Note:** For the translation to work correctly, the target window must remain visible and at the front. If it is minimized or fully covered by another window, the translation will pause or show incorrect results.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

You can customize the translator's behavior by editing the `USER SETTINGS` section at the top of `main.py`.

| Variable                     | Description                                                                                                                            | Default |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `TARGET_LANGUAGE`            | Language to translate TO (e.g., 'en', 'es', 'fr'). [See codes](https://py-google-translator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/languages.html). | `'en'`  |
| `TRANSLATION_WORKER_COUNT`   | Number of parallel processes for translation. Reduce if you face memory errors.                                                        | `4`     |
| `CHANGE_THRESHOLD_PERCENT`   | How much the screen must change (%) to trigger a new translation. Lower is more sensitive but uses more resources.                     | `0.1`   |
| `TESSERACT_MANUAL_PATH`      | Set the full path to `tesseract.exe` if the script can't find it automatically.                                                          | `""`    |
| `DEBUG_MODE`                 | Set to `True` to save debug images and show detailed output.                                                                          | `False` |

**Note:** Source language and OCR language configurations have been moved to `language_config.py` for better organization. The application now uses a dropdown menu for language selection, eliminating the need to manually edit these settings.

## üåç Supported Languages

The application currently supports translation from:
- **Japanese** (Êó•Êú¨Ë™û)
- **Korean** (ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥)
- **Chinese Simplified** (ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá)
- **Chinese Traditional** (ÁπÅÈ´î‰∏≠Êñá)

Languages are configured in the `language_config.py` file and can be easily extended by adding new entries with the appropriate Google Translate language code and Tesseract OCR language pack name.

## ü§î Troubleshooting

-   **"Tesseract Not Found" Error**
    -   Verify that Tesseract is installed and that its installation directory was added to your system's PATH. You can check this by opening a new terminal and running `tesseract --version`.
    -   Restart your terminal or IDE after installation to ensure the new PATH is loaded.
    -   As a last resort, set the `TESSERACT_MANUAL_PATH` variable in the script to the full path of your `tesseract.exe`.

-   **Memory Errors or High CPU Usage**
    -   Lower the `TRANSLATION_WORKER_COUNT` in `main.py` to `2` or `1`. This reduces the number of parallel processes.

-   **Incorrect or No Translations**
    -   Ensure the text in the target window is clear and legible. OCR works best on clean, high-contrast text.
    -   Verify that you've selected the correct source language from the dropdown menu that matches the on-screen content.
    -   Enable "Show original text boxes (red outline)" to visualize what text is being detected by the OCR engine.

-   **Only Some Text is Translated**
    -   The application uses automatic language detection to filter text blocks. Only text that matches your selected source language will be translated.
    -   Enable `DEBUG_MODE` in the settings to see which text blocks are being skipped and why.
    -   Mixed-language content may result in some blocks being skipped if they don't match the selected source language.
